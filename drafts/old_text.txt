We calculated production potential in each suitable cell based on farm design (Table S5), siz size, and the time required to reach harvest size. Each square kilometer of finfish farm was assumed to contain 24 x 9,000-m3 cages stocked with 20 juveniles per m3 for a total of 4.32 million fish per farm. (European Union, 2009)Each square kilometer of bivalve farm was assumed to contain 100 x 4,000-m longlines seeded with 100 bivalves per foot for a total of ~131.2 million bivalves per farm. These farm designs are consistent with best practices in sustainable mariculture (Gentry et al. 2017). We calculated the weight at harvest (Wharv,s, g) from length at harvest (Lharv,s, cm) for species s using species-specific allometric parameters and the length-to-weight equation:
