### Expanding ocean food production under climate change

This is the GitHub repository for a project seeking to understand whether reforms in marine fisheries management and the expansion of marine aquauculture (hereafter called "mariculture") could jointly increase seafood production per capita under climate change. This project is currently under review as: 

Free CM, Cabral RB, Battista W, Ojea E, O’Reilly E, Palardy JE, Froehlich HE, Garcia Molinos J, Siegel K, Arnason R, Juinio-Meñez MA, Fabricius K, Turley C, Gaines SD. Expanding ocean food production under climate change. In first revision at *Nature*.

The repository is organized using the following architecture:

* **data:**
  + **raw:** the raw data used in the analysis
  + **processed:** cleaned data used in the analysis
  + ... scripts for cleaning and exporting the raw data
* **code:** scripts for conducting the analysis and building the tables and figures
* **tables:** tables illustrating analysis results
* **figures:** figures illustrating analysis results
